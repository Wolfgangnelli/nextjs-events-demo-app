1. Static-site Generation (SSG)

2. Server-side Rendering (SSR):
    - Sometimes, you need to pre-render for every requesst OR you need access to the request object (e.g. for cookies) 
      Next.js allows you to run "real server-side code as well" (it's really code that runs on the server only after you deployed it, 
      and which is then re-executed for every incoming request.)
    - That code is added to a function called getServerSideProps() and is an async fun (you can only add it to your page component files)
    - NextJS will execute that function and it will execute it whenever a request for this page is made
    - YOU SHOULD ONLY USE EITHER getStaticProps OR getServerSideProps BECAUSE THEY KIND OF CLASH. (They get props for the component)

3. Client-side rendering (CSR) - Data Fetching:
    - Some data doesn't need to be pre-rendered, examples:
      A. Data changing with high frequency (e.g. stock data)
      B. Highly user-specific data (e.g. last orders in an online shop) 
      C. Partial data (e.g. data that's only used on a part of an page)

    Pre-fetching the data for page generation might not work or be required
    --> "Traditional" client-side data fetching (e.g. useEffect with fetch is fine)
